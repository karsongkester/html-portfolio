<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I've been working in Software QA for 3 years. I've wanted to learn more about coding since I started creating automated tests.</p>

<p>I completed a Software QA bootcamp through Devmountain during the Covid-19 pandemic. I accepted my first manual QA position shortly after completing the course.
  It did not take long for me to begin writing automated tests.
</p>

<p>I'm hoping to continue growing and I believe learning web development will allow me to do that.
  Other than learning web development and working as a QA Automation Engineer, I enjoy hiking, reading, writing, and traveling.
